C1: Understanding of Scientific Knowledge and Research: Examine the work of scientists and the development of scientific theories or bodies of research. For example, extensive fundamental research has resulted in a body of knowledge concerning how cells control their own growth, how they differentiate (i.e., specialize in particular functions) and how they even control their own death. Cognitive scientists have devised many theories concerning how knowledge is represented. The first major problem in building a body of knowledge concerning the behavior of organisms is in deciding how to communicate theories and evidence to other scientists. The examples, background knowledge and hypothesis are represented as logic programs, i.e. sets of definite clauses having the general form head :- body ; Many pertinent questions were asked and both One Cell Systems Scientists and current users of GMD Assays shared their knowledge and experience in answering the questions. For example, through the research conducted at George Washington University, scientists were able to gain some knowledge on how to achieve the best results in dividing embryonic cells.

Subsequent genetic work, including the recognition of mutations (spontaneous changes in genes that can be passed on to offspring), provided a source of \"natural variations\" which Darwin's theory required. Darwin's theory of natural selection argued that the organism that possesses traits that help it to cope successfully with its environment is the one that survives and passes its genes on to its offspring. in Darwin's theory it is the environment which produces changes, or which selects for survival. Darwin's theory of evolutionary selection holds that variation within species occurs randomly and that the survival or extinction of each organism is determined by that organism's ability to adapt to its environment. (True/False) The theory of natural selection proposes that organisms that inherit favorable variations for their environment will tend to survive more often than others. In his evolutionary theory, Darwin proposed that the environment selected the variations, which would give individuals that propagate their offspring. In Lamarck's theory, organisms adapt to their environment by acquiring changes in their lifetime and passing on such changes to their offspring."}

These 4 elements are (1) mutation (2) genetic recombination (3) Natural Selection or differential reproductive success (4) reproductive isolation. They are genetically modified by natural selection of random mutations and recombinations. Because the reproductive rate is so low, the species as a whole adapts very slowly to changing situations or unnatural stress. We know several mechanisms that can produce changes in organisms: natural selection, genetic drift, the founder effect, genetic recombination and mutations are just a few. Most genes have a very low rate of mutation. Other species may be threatened due to overfishing which is exacerbated as a result of the species being naturally rare and restricted in their locations or because they have very low reproductive rates. Goodman (1974) proposed that if a population's size is limited mainly by competition then natural selection will result in an increased competitive ability (K-selection) and, in populations which are not resource limited, selection will result in an increased reproductive rate (r-selection).

In this process pyruvic acid is produced which is catabolised by the mitochondria into carbon dioxide and water or, in the presence of oxygen, into carbon dioxide and ATP. The process of photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts where the sun's radiation is used to combine 12 water molecules with 6 carbon dioxide molecules to form glucose plus 6 oxygen molecules and 6 water molecules. In this process, cells use the energy in sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen. In the process, mitochondria use up oxygen and give off carbon \ndioxide and water."}

If future studies yield the same results, virtually all people who have had heart attacks should be on a combination of a very low-fat diet and a drug to lower cholesterol whether their blood cholesterol levels are high or low.

The study does not suggest that people who have not had heart attacks should take cholesterol-lowering drugs. NUTRITION AND THE HEART There is good evidence that most people, even those who have a family history of heart disease or high blood cholesterol levels, can reduce a major risk of having a heart attack by following a healthy diet. Research Briefs Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital have determined that a cholesterol-lowering drug reduces the risk of heart attack and death from heart disease among heart- attack patients without high cholesterol levels. The researchers excluded men who had been diagnosed with heart disease, who were taking cholesterol lowering drugs or who had suffered a stroke. Furthermore, a study conducted in Scotland and published in 1995 showed that men with high cholesterol levels who had no symptoms of heart disease suffered fewer heart attacks when taking a cholesterol lowering drug over a five year period than those who took a placebo (sugar pill)."}

Plant reproduction Plant reproduction is the production of new individuals or offspring in plants, which can be accomplished by sexual or asexual means. Heredity is the passing of phenotypic traits from parents to their offspring, either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction.

Lenticels are openings that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse between the living cells of the stem and the air. Guard cells regulate the opening and closing of microscopic stomatal pores in the leaf epidermis, thereby regulating rates carbon dioxide uptake. Gas exchange with the atmosphere is controlled by stomata, which can open and close to control water loss, and diffusion of carbon dioxide to the chloroplasts takes place in intercellular spaces between chlorenchyma cells in the stem or in the mesophyll tissue of the leaf.

Because nuclear power plants need some place to discharge the water that cools the reactor, they're all situated near large bodies of water-usually rivers. And nuclear power plants are facing an unusual problem: they need cool water from lakes and rivers to keep operating. Heat Sinks These larger pit areas hold cooling water in the event that there is a problem with the pumps located at the water supply to the plant--normally a river or lake--which would prevent cooling water from reaching the reactor core. In most European power plants the heat from this water is wasted - dumped into rivers or lakes, or pumped through large cooling towers. Many nuclear plants as well as other types of power plants or industrial facilities use cooling towers, cooling lakes or ponds, or other techniques to reduce the effects of heated water discharged directly back into the river, lake, or ocean. Nuclear plants pull huge volumes of cool water from the Great Lakes to absorb heat from the reactors, then they release warm water back into the lakes, changing the habitat for native species of fish and accelerating the growth of algae. That's because the nearby Zion nuclear power plant uses purified lake water to cool down its reactors.

Evolutionists tell us that long, long ago, giraffes had short necks but in times of drought - when food was scarce - the ones with slightly longer necks could reach the higher leaves on the trees, and survive. Thus the long neck of the giraffe results from the fact that earlier giraffes with longer necks than their brethren could reach to higher places for food. In the same way the giraffes got their long necks because in order to reach the tree leaves, which they ate, their necks were stretched so that a short-llecked animal developed to the long-necked giraffe. The Lamarckian view is that modern giraffe's have long necks because their ancestors progressively gained longer necks due to stretching to reach food higher and higher in trees.

We are uncovering a new and unexpected molecular mechanism for mutation in nondividing cells that includes DNA double-strand breaks, recombination, DNA synthesis, and suspension of postsynthesis mismatch repair, and which occurs in a hypermutable subpopulation of the cells. It's caused by defects of mismatch repair genes (MMR) which identify and repair naturally occurring somatic mutations (replication errors) in DNA during cell division. When analogs of purines (e.g., thioguanine) and pyrimidines (e.g., 5-bromouracil) are incorporated into cellular DNA in place of the normal bases, cells become much more sensitive to the lethal effects of both UV and X radiation (A8). If a mutation occurs in one of the known mismatch repair genes, DNA becomes abnormal and predisposes all of the body&#146;s cells to cancer.

MITOSIS : The process of cell reproduction. The female gametophyte is unreduced because the meiocyte, a specialized cell involved in sexual reproduction, fails to undergo meiosis, the process that reduces the chromosome number by half and results in the formation of gametes ( see the discussion of sexual reproduction ). In the reproductive organs (the testes and ovaries) of sexually mature humans a special cell division process (meiosis) halves the number of chromosomes to 23 (called the haploid number), which are packaged into sperm in males and the eggs of females. During the formation of sperm and egg cells, a process of genetic recombination -- or \"crossing over\" -- occurs in which pieces of genetic material are swapped between paired chromosomes. Therapeutic cloning is the process by which a human female donates an egg, a skin cell from a prospective patient is injected into the egg in such a way as to produce a clone and then the embryo is allowed to grow until it contains about 100 cells.

Hemoglobin is the protein found in blood that is responsible for the transport of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide (CO) throughout the body. As well as transporting oxygen to the tissues, this binds carbon monoxide much more efficiently than does human haemoglobin.

Carbon monoxide, after being released from hemoglobin, could also bind to myoglobin, forming carboxymyoglobin, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen transported by myoglobin, diminishing the amount of ATP synthesized, and decreasing the ability of muscle cells to contract.

Non-bacterial soaps had no effect on bacteria tested in terms of resistance to antibiotics. Propagation of these resistant, nonpathogenic bacteria increases the reservoir of resistance traits in the \nbacterial population as a whole and raises the odds that such traits will spread to pathogens. Acquired Resistance Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics, e.g. bacterial populations previously-sensitive to antibiotics become resistant. beneficial genes, like those for antibiotic resistance, may be spread very rapidly through bacterial populations. is there already resistance to the antibiotic in bacterial populations? transmission and maintenance of such plasmids in bacterial populations contribute significantly to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence among pathogenic bacterial species.

Mate Choice = A Maternal Effect : In recent studies of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus , and the love bug, Plecia nearctica , we have found evidence that females selecting large males as mates can increase life time reproductive success as well as egg size ( Fox , McLennan &amp; Mousseau 1995; In the same way that insects can develop a resistance to chemical pesticides, the behavioral resistance theory proposes that after multiple generations of mating with sterile males, a more savvy strain of wild females may have emerged. The actions of classical teratogens can be recognized from the patterns of birth defects they produce. The first is birth control in all its variations, the fact that women can now and have been for some time, able to control their reproduction which changes the size of families, changes demographics and frees them up from the burdens of child rearing to a large extent. Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring. These diagnoses are benign, but can only be made by your doctor who can examine you in person and differentiate them from any possible worrisome process.

During the summer months, hundreds of turtles can be seen mating in the water, laying eggs on the islands, and baby sea turtles can be seen hatching from their nests. ^ Behavior Baby turtles use their egg tooth when they hatch to break the shell of the egg. Females lay so many eggs because the chance for their survival is very low. Alligators lay their eggs in nests, and not only guard the nests but dig up the eggs when they begin to hatch, and carry the baby alligators down to the water in their jaws."}

Prokaryotes reproduce themselves by a method called binary fission where the parent cell divides into two identical daughter cells, this along with their speed of reproduction, size and their ability to change their metabolism has enabled them to be successful for so long. Prokaryotic fission, which is binary fission, is a form of asexual reproduction and cell division used by all prokaryotes, (bacteria and archaebacteria), and some organelles within eukaryotic organisms (e.g., mitochondria). Bacteria reproduce by the process of binary fission (below, right), in which one parent divides into two identical daughter cells (6). It is assumed that prokaryotic cells arising from a single colony are genetically identical since they reproduce via binary fission (a form of asexual reproduction). For example, some cells can reproduce through one or both of two methods, asexual (fission), or sexual reproduction that requires combining genetic material from another cell (fusion).

This means that the virus has entered the skin at some point and altered the DNA structure of the human cell, usually causing no visible or apparent changes in the cellular structure. It has certain inhibiting effects on molecular pathological changes caused by viruses, increases growth of plasma cells, stimulates synthesis of antibodies, and builds up body defense.

Similarly, the peppered moth in England was mostly light in color, with a very small frequency of dark individuals who were quickly eaten by birds because they hung out on white birch trees. The three moth colors are black/white/newspaper. Rise of industrial revolution led to environemntal change (black sooty trees), which led to a change in the color of moths that live on the bark of birch trees. But in the late eighteen hundreds, soot from English factories darkened the normally light colored birch trees the moths landed on. So an adaption that camouflaged the moths before now made them highly visible Light moths on soot covered trees visible; Previous to the soot problem, the light-colored variety of the moth (called typis ) was common in England (its speckled coloration helped camouflage the moth when perched on birch tree trunks).

Growth is obviously complex and the most important hormones that influence growth include, growth hormone, thyroid hormones, insulin, testosterone and oestrogen. 37 During pregnancy, the uterus itself takes on hormonal functions through the production of placental hormones: chorionic gonadotropin, estrogens and progestrone. During pregnancy, the hormone progesterone is produced in the placenta, which relaxes the smooth muscles of the uterus. The hormones estrogen and progesterone, which prepare the uterus for pregnancy, decrease considerably, although small amounts of estrogen may still be produced."}

Ultraviolet radiation can addle DNA, the spiral molecule that forms genes, and create potentially cancerous mutations in skin cells. Only one chromosome of each pair is passed into a gamete during meiosis, to be inherited by the offspring. Experts believe that much of this increase is due to people's greater exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation, which can cause misspellings in DNA and, as a result, damage skin cells. Ultraviolet light from the sun, for example, can cause mutations in our skin, resulting in a benign form of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma. 50% of the agouti offspring of the chimera will inherit the mutation from the injected ES cells. Radiation-induced mutations seem to be brought about by the deletion of small pieces of chromosomes during the process of chromosome breakage and repair, and if such changes occur in egg-producing or sperm-producing cells they may be inherited by the offspring. Ultraviolet (UV) light from overexposure to the sun damages skin cells, altering their DNA, which can create cancerous mutations.

For example, a decrease in the sex hormone levels stimulates the pituitary to release larger amounts of the two hormones--a negative feedback control mechanism. A negative feedback mechanism normally decreases production of parathyroid hormone as the ionized serum calcium level increases. These AEDs also increase sex hormone binding globulins leading to decreased free hormone levels, a possible contributing mechanism. Alcoholism and renal failure can increase the level of the feminine hormone oestrogen in men, causing loss of sexual desire.

Effective wildlife management has led to an appreciable increase in prey and predator populations. Predators usually lag behind their prey species in their natural population fluctuations. Unless there is a natural prey refuge or there is a limit by some other species to a predator population, the predator can eliminate the prey everywhere. The Return of Top predators The roles of top predators in ecosystems is far-reaching and, it has been argued, their absence from an ecosystem may have profound negative effects felt throughout the entire ecological community.

For these items, source reduction steps and design changes that allow packaging to fit into evolving community recycling programs will deliver the greatest environmental benefits. Human activities that adversely affect ecosystem resilience such as reduction of biodiversity, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, land-use, and anthropogenic climate change are increasingly causing regime shifts in ecosystems, often to less desirable and degraded conditions. This reduction of biodiversity, is caused directly or indirectly by pesticides. Over the past several centuries, human-caused land use and land cover change (LUCC) has led to the loss of biodiversity, which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Solar and wind are not practical ways to power a car, and hybrid and electricity cars still use electricity, which in many cases is generated by burning fossil fuels. Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity, and some use nuclear power, but there is an increasing use of cleaner renewable sources such as solar, wind, wave and hydroelectric. The Wind Power Production Incentive, or WPPI, was a program of the Canadian Government that promoted the generation of electricity from wind power in Canada to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas that would otherwise enter the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. Also included in this industry are the manufacture of wind and solar powered turbine generators and windmills for generating electric power. The use of solar power in place of electricity generated from imported fossil fuels not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also other pollutants such as SOx x particulates and oxides of nitrogen arising from the combustion of fossil fuels. Conserving electricity reduces the amount of fossil fuels being burned as does using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or water power. Turbine generators (turbines directly connected to electric generators) use steam, wind, hot gas or falling water to generate power. In the Third World, electrical power generation is becoming economical, and the use of turbines is increasing. While we have reduced our consumption of fossil fuel generated electricity, we remain committed to increasing our reliance on alternative sources of electrical generation including further solar installations and the use of urban wind power."}

From the properties of ocean water to unique phenomena such as deep ocean currents and tides, we discover a wondrous ecosystem that supports an incredibly diverse collection of living organisms. Human wastes, ground-up garbage, water from bathing, and plastics all contribute to ocean dumping. Changing ocean currents, caused by shifts in the trade winds blowing over the Pacific, result in a warming of the ocean's surface waters, particularly in the eastern Pacific. Since equatorial Pacific waters eventually drift via currents into areas where iron is not limited, the primary waters to focus on for effective results is the Antarctic Ocean which covers approximately 20% of the ocean surface. The local water masses are derived from Pacific Ocean water masses transported in to the area and modified by processes on the shelf. Coastal development has caused environmental degradation of marine ecosystems, including fragile coastal nursery areas used by open-ocean species, with increased erosion, sewage, toxic chemicals, and industrial pollution in rivers. For example, 5 Gyres is an organization aimed at reducing plastics pollution in the oceans, and was one of two organizations that recently researched the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

From the tiniest plant to humans, all higher organisms are dependant on reduced forms of nitrogen -- such as ammonia and amino acids -- to live. Reduced nitrogen enters the human body as dietary free amino acids, protein, and the ammonia produced by intestinal tract bacteria. One advantage with Flourish is that the nitrogen source is in the form of amino acids which are utilized as preferentially as ammonia is and even if the amino acids are broken down by bacteria, it is broken down in to ammonia first which can be utilized by the plants as well. These organisms are able to convert nitrogen gas into ammonia (NH 3 ), which they use to make amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and other nitrogenous compounds. Bacteria can use ammonia or urea as nitrogen sources to build amino acids.

Active transport proteins use energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient, for example when the coupled sodium/potassium pump uses ATP and removes sodium from a nerve cell while importing potassium. Active transport Transmembrane proteins, called transporters, use the energy of ATP to force ions or small molecules through the membrane against their concentration gradient. Molecules and ions can be moved against their concentration gradient, but this process, called active transport , requires the expenditure of energy (usually from ATP).

There was no lake to lake variation in mean thiamine concentrations of prey species, but considerable within species variation occurred that was unrelated to size. Within some genera there is considerable variation in coloration, color pattern, or size of the species.
